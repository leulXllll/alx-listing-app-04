# ALX Listing App

## Project Description
The ALX Listing App is a web application designed to create an Airbnb clone listing page. The goal of the project is to provide users with a platform to browse, list, and book various properties. This application aims to deliver a user-friendly interface, smooth navigation, and a responsive design, making it easy for users to find their ideal accommodations.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:

- **components/**: This directory contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. Each component is designed to encapsulate specific functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **interfaces/**: This folder includes TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of data used in the application. These interfaces help ensure type safety and improve code clarity.

- **constants/**: The constants directory holds configuration settings and constant values used across the application. This includes API endpoints, default settings, and other fixed values that do not change during runtime.

- **public/assets/**: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets that are publicly accessible. These assets are essential for the visual and functional aspects of the application.
